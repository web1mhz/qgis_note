This course explains the process of overlapping Naver maps and existing GIS data.

1. Coordinate system must be matched in order to overlap Naver map with existing GIS data

2. Neighbor map coordinate system: EPSG: 5179, existing data is EPSG: 4326 (WGS84)

3. Naver maps are not coordinate transformed
??? We need to coordinate and transform the data we create to nest.

??? - Naver Map Loading

??? - Import existing GIS data (WGS84 coordinates)

????? *** The two data are not overlapping because their coordinates do not match.
???
??? - Converting existing GIS data to EPSG: 5179

4. If the nested result is successful

This time is a little difficult.
Understanding by head is forgotten tomorrow. Always get used to your body.
If you do the same thing 100 times, it accumulates in your own pocket.

I will finish this course.
