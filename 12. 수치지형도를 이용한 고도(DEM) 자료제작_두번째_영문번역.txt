This lesson explains the second step of creating a map of elevation (DEM) using a digital topographic map.

* DEM: Digital Elevation Model

1. Downloading the National Geospatial Information Portal (dxf file)

???- http://www.nsdi.go.kr

2. National Geospatial Portal Digital Topographic DXF file is GRS80TM coordinates (EPSG: 5186)


3. Convert a DXF file to a Shape (Shp) file containing altitude values ??for GIS analysis

4. Contour extraction with input of elevation value


??- 1: 5,000 scale topographic map
??The contour line is 5m
??The valley line is 25m
??The curve is made at intervals of 5m.

??-1: 25,000 scale digital map
?Cascade 50m
?Curved line 10m

??- Contour-related layer codes in a digital topographic map
????7111: Curvature line (convex) 7121 (concave)
????7112: Liver curve (convex) 7122 (concave)
????7113: Curved line (convex) 7123 (concave)
????7114: Raised line 7124 (concave)

??- Layer codes related to elevation in a digital topographic map
????7217: Elevation point


4. IDW Interpolation for Elevation Maps (DEM) Mapping

???- Spatial resolution (pixel size): 30m x 30m


* IDW Interpolation: Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) Interpolation
??
Because this is an open source program, it can take a lot of time and error
Be patient and have a cup of coffee until the DEM map is complete.


I will finish this course.
