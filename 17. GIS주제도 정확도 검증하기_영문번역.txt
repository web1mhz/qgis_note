This lesson explains the process of evaluating the accuracy of a topic produced by GIS function.

1. Import SRTM30m elevation map (DEM)

2. Import survey point data including altitude values measured in the field



3. Extraction of SRTM30m DEM value by survey site


4. Import the altitude values from the field altitude values and the altitude values extracted from the SRTM30m elevation map into Excel

5. Correlation is as high as 0.997, so the accuracy of the SRTM30m elevation map can be said to be high

I will complete the course above.
