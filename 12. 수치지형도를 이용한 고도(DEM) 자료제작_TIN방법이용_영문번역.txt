This lesson explains the second step of creating a map of elevation (DEM) using a digital topographic map.

* DEM: Digital Elevation Model

1. Downloading the National Geospatial Information Portal (dxf file)

???- http://www.nsdi.go.kr

2. National Geospatial Portal Digital Topographic DXF file is GRS80TM coordinates (EPSG: 5186)


3. Convert a DXF file to a Shape (Shp) file containing altitude values ??for GIS analysis

4. Contour extraction with input of elevation value


- 1: 5,000-scale digital topographical contour lines are produced at intervals of 5m
??25m intervals for valleys, 5m intervals for bridges

-1: 25,000 scale Digital contours of the topographic map are produced at intervals of 10m
?50m increments, 10m increments

- Contour-related layer codes in a digital topographic map
??7111: Curvature line (convex) 7121 (concave)
??7112: Liver curve (convex) 7122 (concave)
??7113: Curved line (convex) 7123 (concave)
??7114: Raised line 7124 (concave)

- Layer codes related to elevation in a digital topographic map
??7217: Elevation point

4. Perform TIN interpolation for elevation (DEM) mapping

???- Spatial resolution (pixel size): 30m x 30m


* TIN Interpolation: Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) Interpolation
??
Because this is an open source program, it can take a lot of time and error
Be patient and have a cup of coffee until the DEM map is complete.


I will finish this course.
