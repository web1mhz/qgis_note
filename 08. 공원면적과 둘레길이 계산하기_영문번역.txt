This lesson explains the process of calculating area and perimeter length.

1. Import existing park boundary files

2. Check the coordinate system

3. Using the property table to calculate the area and perimeter of the park

?? - Check coordinate system

?? - In the case of WGS84 coordinate system (EPSG: 4326)
???? Must be converted to a two-dimensional coordinate system to calculate area and circumference length

4. Coordinate transformation

?? - Because the two files have different coordinate systems
?? - Only files with 2D coordinates need to be reloaded for normal calculation

5. Confirm that the coordinate system is changed to EPSG: 5186

6. Open the attribute table and calculate the area and perimeter length

This time is a little difficult.
Understanding by head is forgotten tomorrow. Always get used to your body.
If you do the same thing 100 times, it accumulates in your own pocket.

I will finish this course.
