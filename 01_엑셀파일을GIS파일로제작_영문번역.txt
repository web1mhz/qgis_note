This tutorial explains how to create a GIS file using an Excel file.


1. Enter the GPS data in the Excel file.

??? Note: GPS data is WGS84 coordinates with latitude and longitude coordinates.

2. The important fields here are x_ longitude and y_ latitude.

3. Now convert the Excel file to CSV file to import into QGIS.

4. Import the converted CSV file into QGIS.

5. Now I end up saving my GIS file as a Shp file permanently to my computer.


I will finish this course.

Understanding by head is forgotten tomorrow. Always get used to your body.

If you do the same thing 100 times, it accumulates in your own pocket.
