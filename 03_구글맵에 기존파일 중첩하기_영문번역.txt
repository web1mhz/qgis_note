This tutorial will show you how to nest existing GIS files in Google Maps.

1. Importing Google Maps

??? - Lecture 3. Refer to Google Maps Import

2. Check the coordinate system

3. Import GIS file
??? - If the GIS is loaded but not visible
????? This is because the coordinates of Google map coordinates and GIS data are not the same.

- Google Map Coordinates: EPSG: 3857
- GIS data created in Lecture 1 is WGS84 (= EPSG: 4326)

- Therefore, coordinates must match
- You need to convert the GIS data created in Lesson 1 to EPSG: 3857.


Very easy content.
Understanding by head is forgotten tomorrow. Always get used to your body.
If you do the same thing 100 times, it accumulates in your own pocket.

I will finish this course.
