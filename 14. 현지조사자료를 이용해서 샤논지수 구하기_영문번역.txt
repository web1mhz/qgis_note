This lecture explains the calculation of the biodiversity index Shannon Index using field survey data.

* Shannon index: shannon-wiener index

- Alpha diversity.
- Shannon exponential equation = -1 x total [(number of species / total number of species) * ln (number of species / total number of species)]

[Reference]
* Species Abundance: Number of Species in Species
* Relative capitals: Percentage of each species in the community
* High diversity of species is higher when the wind velocity is high and the relative water value is even.

1. Importing survey data
????
???- Example: Use of Mudeungsan National Park Flora field survey

2. Obtaining species numbers by eliminating species duplication in field survey data
3. Obtaining the number of species

4. Obtaining species ratio by species / total population
5. Apply log function to classification ratio
6. Multiply numbers 4 and 5 and multiply by -1 to avoid negative numbers
7. Finally, add all the values ??to calculate the Shannon index
8. Moody's National Park Flora Diversity Index is: 1.494119

This is not difficult.

I will finish this course.
