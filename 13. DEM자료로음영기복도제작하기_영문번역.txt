This lecture explains the process of creating shaded relief maps using elevation (DEM) maps.

* Shadow relief (hillshade): Variation of elevation

- Mainly used mainly to express 3D terrain

1. Import a map of elevation (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m using TIN interpolation
????
??? - Spatial resolution = pixels size

* TIN Interpolation: Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) Interpolation

2. Shadow relief production

This is not difficult.

I will finish this course.
