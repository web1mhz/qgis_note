This lecture explains the process of producing mountain slope map and slope map using elevation (DEM) map.



1. Import a map of elevation (DEM) with a spatial resolution of 30 m using TIN interpolation
????
??? - Spatial resolution = pixels size

* TIN Interpolation: Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) Interpolation

2. Production of mountain slope

3. Production of slope (= oblique direction)
??

This is not difficult. Perform 100 times until you get used to it

I will finish this course.
