This lesson explains the process of importing Naver maps.

1. Because it is difficult to confirm the site only at the survey site,
? It is necessary to know the site by aerial photograph.

?? - Method: Checking via Naver Map

2. Naver maps can be imported as plugins from QGIS


3. Check the coordinate system of Naver map

?? - Naver map is different from GPS coordinate (= WGS84 coordinate system)
???? It does not match the existing WGS84 data.
?? - So you have to check the coordinate system.

?? - Neighbor map coordinate system is EPSG: 5179


This time is a little difficult.
Understanding by head is forgotten tomorrow. Always get used to your body.
If you do the same thing 100 times, it accumulates in your own pocket.

I will finish this course.
