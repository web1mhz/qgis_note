This lesson describes the process of coordinate transformation.

1. The GPS coordinates are based on the WGS84 coordinate system.
??? In QGIS, it is called EPSG: 4326.

2. Because 3-D coordinates use degrees when calculating area or length
??? To calculate the area or length, you need to convert it to 2 dimensions.

??? Korea usually uses the GRS80 TM coordinate system.
??? QGIS is called EPSG: 5186.

3. Convert WGS84 coordinates (EPSG: 4326) to GRS80 TM coordinates (EPSG: 5186)

? - Then the WGS84 coordinate system data is loaded.

??? Note: Google Map Coordinate: EPSG: 3857 (WGS84 / Pseudo Mercator)


This time is a little difficult.
Understanding by head is forgotten tomorrow. Always get used to your body.
If you do the same thing 100 times, it accumulates in your own pocket.

I will finish this course.
