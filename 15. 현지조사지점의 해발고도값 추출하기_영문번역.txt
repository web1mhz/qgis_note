This lecture explains the process of extracting the altitude value according to the survey point.


1. Installing the Point sampling tool plug-in


2. Import Elevation Maps (DEM) - Raster Data


3. Importing Flora Locations - Vector Resources


4. The altitude data is EPSG: 5179 and the vegetation location data is WGS84

??? The plant location data should be converted to EPSG: 5179.

5. Coordinate transformation of vegetation position data

4. Extract elevation value of survey point using point sampling tool


4. Extract elevation value of survey point using point sampling tool

5. The text is strange ... Correction

I will complete the course above.
